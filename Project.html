    <p>Having been an intern for Admissions for almost two years now, I would love to create a computerized admissions
       tracker system for the office that would save time and improve efficiency when retrieving information about the
       department. The various stakeholders involved are high school students, teachers, parents, identifiable bodies 
       and organizations across Africa. 

       The database should:
       <ul>
           <li> Keep record of all the applicants </li>
           <li> Display Partnerships with the school </li>
           <li> Keep tabs on Employees and Interns</li>
           <li> Keep a record of high School/Organization Tours </li>
           
       </ul>
    
    
    </p>
